# C# Tutorial - Basics of C#.

This tutorial covers various fundamental concepts of C# programming.

## Introduction

This tutorial was created by following the code examples and guidance from this [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8), and while I did not learn much as I already knew these topics, it was a great way to refresh my knowledge about C#. The tutorial includes a numbered list of essential topics to help beginners get started with C# programming.

## Basic Concepts
1. Preparing the environment: Setting up the development environment for C# programming.

2. Drawing a shape using `Console.WriteLine("");`: Drawing a simple shape using the `Console.WriteLine` method.

3. Variables: string, integer: Understanding how to declare and use variables to store different data types.

4. Data types: string `" "`, char `' '`, int `25`, bool `true/false`; float `0.5`, double `4.256`, decimal: Exploring the various data types available in C# and their uses.

5. Strings: Newline, Concatenation; ToUpper, ToLower, Contains, IndexOf, Substring: Learning about string manipulation, including adding new lines, concatenating strings, and extracting substrings.

6. Working with numbers: Mathematical Operations, Math method: Performing basic mathematical operations on numbers and utilising the `Math` class for more complex operations.

7. Getting user input: `Console.ReadLine();`: Taking input from the user during program execution.

8. Building a calculator: Converting values: Creating a simple calculator application and converting user input to numerical values.

9. Building a Mad Libs Game: Interpolation: Implementing a fun Mad Libs game using string interpolation to create dynamic stories.

10. Arrays: Creating, accessing values, updating and populating arrays: Learning how to work with arrays, including creating, accessing, and updating their elements.

11. Methods: creating them and passing values: Understanding how to define methods to encapsulate code and pass data to them as parameters.

12. Return Statement: Learning how to use the `return` statement to send a value back from a method to the caller.

13. If statements: AND `&&`, OR `||`, negation `!` operators, comparison operators: Using conditional statements to make decisions in the code based on specific conditions.

14. Switch statements: cases, default, break: Implementing switch statements to handle multiple cases and make code decisions based on different values.

15. While loops / Do-While loops: Creating loops that execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.

16. Word Guessing Game: Creating an interactive game where the player guesses a secret word within a limited number of attempts to win.

17. For loops: variable initialization, looping through arrays: Using `for` loops to iterate over a specific range of values or elements in an array.

18. Exponent method: Implementing a method to calculate the exponentiation of a number.

19. 2D arrays: `[,]`: Learning how to work with two-dimensional arrays to store data in a tabular form.

20. Exception handling: Try...Catch blocks: Using try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and recover from errors in the code.

## Object-Oriented Programming
21. Classes and Objects: Understanding the concepts of classes and objects, the building blocks of object-oriented programming.

22. Constructors: Learning about constructors, special methods used for initializing objects.

23. Object Methods: Exploring methods that can be defined within a class and operate on objects of that class.

24. Getters and Setters: Implementing getters and setters to control access to class properties.

25. Static Class Attributes: Understanding static attributes, which are shared across all instances of a class.

26. Static Methods and Classes: Defining static methods and classes that do not require an instance of the class to be called.

27. Inheritance: Superclass / Subclass; virtual / override: Learning about inheritance, where one class can inherit properties and methods from another.
